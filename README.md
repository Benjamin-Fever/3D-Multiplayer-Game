# 3D-Multiplayer-Game
Using Unity I made a Server and Client system to host and connect to eachother. I used unitys built in solution to networking solution Netcode for game objects
In this the player can move around a small world and jump around the main complexety lies in the multiplayer connection as when hosted another player can join the
game and do run around with the player. For this server hosting a used a IC2 lunix instance to host a lunix verison of my game that was just connecting pairs to eachother. This was a great learning experience to learn using the AWS service as well as learning more Unity
